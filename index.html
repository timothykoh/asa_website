                <img src="images/cmu_logo.png" width="200px" alt="">
                <p>ASA participates in a long list of campus events, as well as host our own events and fundraisers as we conjure up new ideas every semester. This list includes Culture Night, Relay For Life, Multicultural Late Night, 1000 Plus, Wavin’ Flags, Volleyball Tournament, ECAASU, Ski Trip, Valentine’s Day Date Auction, themed club parties, banquets and formals. Between these, we also organize lots of informal social events where members just come to hang out: BBQ, S’Mores Night, Half-Off Late Nights, snack breaks and study groups!</p>

                <h1>Booth</h1>
                <img src="images/trophy_icon.png" alt="">
                <p>ASA is the current winner for booth. It is a competition to build the best two storey structure for CMU’s Spring Carnival, and it's one of our biggest activities of the year. All the general body members, board members, and even alumni will come out and help build an amazing booth, which will hopefully win first place! Through the times we spend together building our booth and organizing other events, ASA members develop close friendships that last a lifetime.</p>
